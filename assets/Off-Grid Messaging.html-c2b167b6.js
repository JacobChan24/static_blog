Do you want to save data on a trip abroad? Or, do you simply want to stay anonymous while sending a message? Then check out these offline messaging apps that let you send messages without internet or cell tower connection!</strong></p><p>Text messages, messenger apps, e-mails, social media... there are a gazillion ways to stay connected these days. However, all of these communication tools have one thing in common: they require access to public infrastructure, like a Wi-Fi router or a cell tower. But what if you don&#39;t have access to, or are trying to avoid that kind of infrastructure?</p><p>That&#39;s when offline messaging apps come in. They don&#39;t require internet or cell phone towers, but still let you send messages with your phone. We explain how the technology works, when it might come in handy, and if they&#39;re a real alternative to other messaging apps.</p><h2 id="what-is-offline-messaging-and-how-does-it-work" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-offline-messaging-and-how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is offline messaging, and how does it work?</h2><p>Offline messaging is a new trend in secure communication. The off-grid messenger apps, also known as mesh messengers, don&#39;t need access to public infrastructure like cell phone towers or internet to send messages from one phone to another. Instead, they rely on Bluetooth or direct Wi-Fi connection.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth</strong></p><p>Two devices are able to use Bluetooth to set up a secure peer-to-peer connection. It&#39;s the same technology when you use Bluetooth to transfer music or images from one device to another. The maximum range between devices is about 300 feet, or 100 meters.</p><p><strong>Direct Wi-Fi</strong></p><p>Unlike a Wi-Fi signal you connect to from a router, direct Wi-Fi (sometimes also called ad-hoc Wi-Fi) is a limited connection that is created between two phones. The wireless connection only exists between the two devices, which is why it&#39;s also called aÂ <strong>single-hop communication</strong>. Regular wireless networks typically use multihop communication. The range of a direct Wi-Fi connection is roughly about 200 feet, or 60 meters.</p><p><strong>P2P messaging</strong></p><p>Neither Bluetooth nor direct Wi-Fi allow for a wide range when trying to send messages between two phones. You basically have to be at proximity to be able to communicate. There is, however, a way to increase the distance a message is able to travel: through a peer-to-peer mode (P2P).</p><p>Some mesh messaging apps have a P2P mode. When turned on, the signal is able to piggyback from one cell phone to the next, until it reaches its intended destination. Basically, multiple phones create a path of communication. The more phones you have, the further a message is able to travel. Important: While other people&#39;s phones are used to send a message, only the sender and the receiver are able to see the content of the message. The other phones just act as signal amplifiers.</p><p>Aside from P2P mode, you can also use gadgets to extend the signal, such as Go Tenna Mesh.</p><h2 id="from-camping-trips-to-political-protests-when-off-grid-messaging-comes-in-handy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#from-camping-trips-to-political-protests-when-off-grid-messaging-comes-in-handy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> From camping trips to political protests: when off-grid messaging comes in handy</h2><p>In a world where there is a free Wi-Fi signal at almost any corner, and cell phone coverage is so extensive, it might seem obsolete to even worry about offline messaging. Yet, there are some situations when off-grid messaging apps can come in really handy.</p><p><strong>In the middle of nowhere</strong></p><p>Imagine you&#39;re on a camping trip in the middle of nowhere. Your buddies and you went hiking, but somehow you got off the trail, and don&#39;t see them anymore. You can&#39;t call or text them because... well, you&#39;re in the middle of nowhere with no signal. With offline messaging apps though, you are still able to get a message out to them to let them know that you are lost.</p><p><strong>Traveling</strong></p><p>There might also be situations when you&#39;re out of data, or simply don&#39;t want to use your data or a Wi-Fi connection to send messages. If you&#39;re traveling abroad or on a cruise ship, for example, it&#39;s very expensive to use your data, and cruise ships usually limit your free daily Wi-Fi usage. So, instead of spending a lot of money on roaming or the ship&#39;s Wi-Fi service, you can communicate through your offline messaging service.</p><p><strong>Limiting internet time for kids</strong></p><p>Even for parents off-grid messenger apps could be interesting if you limit your children&#39;s daily internet time, but still want them to be able to communicate.</p><p><strong>Natural disasters</strong></p><p>Sometimes, a storm or flood cuts off all regular lines of communications, and you are not even able to talk to your neighbor or call for help. Offline messenger apps can come in really handy in critical situations like this.</p><p><strong>Political protests</strong></p>',27),p={href:"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/protests-tech-company-spying",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},d=e("p",null,"Also, in a war situation, like during the current war in Ukraine, people might be worried that their communication could be monitored.
